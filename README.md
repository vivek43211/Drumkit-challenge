<p>
 the Drum Kit Challenge, a responsive website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interactive project allows users to play drum sounds by either clicking on the drum images or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Each drum instrument is seamlessly linked to its respective sound through advanced DOM manipulation techniques and event handling. The project highlights the use of properties such as addEventListener, querySelector, and setTimeout, alongside custom functions like makeSounds() and addAnimation() to enhance functionality and performance. Dynamic animations triggered by user interactions further elevate the user experience, showcasing proficiency in event-driven programming and efficient coding practices.
